Sure, here are the steps on how to create video using AI:

1. Choose an AI video generator. There are a number of AI video generators available, such as Synthesia, InVideo, and Make-A-Video. Each of these generators has its own strengths and weaknesses, so it's important to choose one that's right for your needs.
2. Write a script. The script is the foundation of your video, so it's important to take the time to write a good one. The script should include your video's content, as well as any specific instructions for the AI generator.
3. Choose a template. Most AI video generators offer a variety of templates to choose from. These templates can help you create a professional-looking video without having to start from scratch.
4. Add your content. Once you've chosen a template, you can start adding your content. This includes your script, as well as any images, videos, or other media that you want to include in your video.
5. Generate the video. Once you've added all of your content, you can generate the video. This process can take a few minutes, depending on the length and complexity of your video.

Here are some additional tips for creating video using AI:

* Keep your videos short and to the point. AI video generators can be used to create long videos, but it's often better to keep your videos short and sweet. This will help keep your viewers engaged.
* Use clear and concise language. When writing your script, use clear and concise language that your viewers will understand. Avoid using jargon or technical terms that your viewers may not be familiar with.
* Use high-quality images and videos. If you're using images or videos in your video, make sure they're high-quality. This will help your video look professional and polished.

With these tips in mind, you can create engaging and informative videos using AI.
